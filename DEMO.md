### Script Outline

```
0:00 - Introduction
"Welcome to the FHEVM SDK demonstration. In this video, I'll show you
how to build confidential dApps with our universal SDK that works across
React, Vue, Next.js, and Node.js."

0:30 - Quick Start
"Let's start by cloning the repository and installing dependencies.
As you can see, it's a monorepo structure with workspaces..."

[Continue with each section]

19:30 - Conclusion
"That's the FHEVM SDK. With less than 10 lines of code, you can add
FHE encryption to any JavaScript application. Check out our documentation
and examples to get started. Thank you for watching!"
